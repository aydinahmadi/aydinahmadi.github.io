        BabyLM challenge
      </a>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Comparison of Decoder and Encoder-only Models on the Dataset </strong><br>
          Developed a GPT2-based decoder-only model using the Hugging Face library to tackle the BabyLM challenge.
          Training and evaluation were performed from scratch on the challenge dataset.<br>

    <li><strong>Enhancing DDPG with Hindsight and Prioritized Replay Buffers</strong><br>
      Investigated the efficacy of augmenting the DDPG algorithm with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and
      Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) to improve learning performance. Compared a basic DDPG approach with sparse rewards
      against a modified version employing HER + PER on PandaGym tasks.<br>
