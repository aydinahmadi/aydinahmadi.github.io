        <li><strong>Comparing Style Transfer Methods</strong><br>
          Explored various style transfer techniques including AdaIN, Perceptual Loss, and a basic approach, implemented using PyTorch and TensorFlow.
          Training and evaluation were conducted on parts of the WikiArt and MSCOCO datasets to analyze the effectiveness of each method.<br>

    <li><strong>Comparing DDPG and SAC for Robotics Tasks</strong><br>
      Compared the performance of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms for robotic tasks.
      Implementations from the Stable-Baselines framework were contrasted with custom code in the PandaGym environment,
      focusing on pushing and reaching tasks.<br>
