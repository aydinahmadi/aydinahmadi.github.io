    <p>I graduated from Koç University in Computer Engineering and Science. My research interests include Robotics, Model-Based Control, Reinforcement Learning, Perception, and Long-Horizon Planning. I focus on developing algorithms that enable robots to learn task-agnostic and task-specific behaviors, integrating planning, perception, and control methods such as MPC, Reinforcement Learning, and deep learning for real-world applications. I also explore grasping, navigation, and in-hand manipulation.</p>

    <p>During my studies, I gained experience in Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision with Deep Learning, and Embodied Intelligence using tools such as Stable Baselines, OpenAI Gym, Hugging Face models, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. I worked in the <a href="https://ai.ku.edu.tr/" target="_blank">KUIS AI Lab</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5sL0xZ4AAAAJ&hl=en" target="_blank">Prof. Barış Akgün</a>, developing model-based approaches for planar object manipulation with robotic systems like the Franka Emika Panda and ROS.</p>
